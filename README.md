# ParallelProgramingHomework1
## Overview
This is Homework 1 in the Parallel Programing discipline of my 2nd year studying at Plovdiv Puniversity "Paisii Hilendarski".
This is a command-line application that does tasks on a file with text first synchronously and then in parallel and shows the time each completion took.
The tasks are:
- Count the words
- Find the shortest word (this application finds all words with the shortest length)
- Find the longest word (this application finds all words with the longest length)
- Find the average word length
- Find the five most common words
- Find the five least common words
## How to use
You can run the application from a command line application and provide files to it as arguments or drag and drop files over the executable file once the application is built.
